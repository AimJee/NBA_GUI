# NBA_GUI
Advanced Programming Project
Please read the requirements.txt.

This project was carried out as part of the Advanced Programming course at the University of Lausanne. The project was carried out in April-May 2023. 

It consists of creating a GUI, making predictions about NBA matches using LOGIT regressions and seeing whether the latter give an advantage when placing sports bets. 

To launch the GUI, simply run __init__.py !
Update the csv file of games by going to Betting and insert the dates and press Load. 
Dont use Predictions on a season without having loaded some matches before.

To run the tests, simply run Test_strategies.py. At the end of the code you can change the parameters. 

To start optimising the combinations, simply run Optimization.py. Be careful it can take up to 6 hours.

The GUI can be outdated if the sites from which we get the data change. 
The first csv file called game.csv comes from the brilliant https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball. Thanks Wyatt !
